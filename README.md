Project Rakshak

One of most prominent problems as seen at the times of the COVID outbreak was that people were unable to find out whether the hospital located at their vicinity had beds available or not and if yes, then in which ward - General or Special. The primary reason for the detection of this problem was the sudden rise in the number of patients wanting to be admitted in critical condition. This problem almost crashed our entire healthcare system and should not be taken lightly.
The second problem that we observed was that people were unable to find out whether a particular doctor was available to treat them or if his patient count for the day was already fulfilled. This caused the patients' health to deteriorate even further due to not receiving a proper treatment on time. This can be thought as an extension of the above problem statement that we aim to solve simultaneously with our software.
Moreover, another aspect that we wish to look after is that many a times people often have a general medical query but visiting a doctor is not feasible for them, also ‘ask the google’ concept is not advisable when it concerns our medical health.
We propose a centralized system where various hospitals would be invited to register themselves. The hospitals would require to fill in the details about various departments that they cater to and the name and qualifications of the doctors along with their schedules for the week. They would also require to update the patient count for each doctor for each day. Patients would also be able to schedule an appointment with the doctor on any given day based on the availability of the slot and the doctor. This system would work similar to BookMyShow - the popular ticket booking app. This feature would draw much of the userbase to the system.

Now focusing on the primary problem, this would also work similar to the system that we discussed above except that the patient would not be able to book a bed. This would strictly be based on doctor's advice and the hospitals would use their internal systems to allocate beds. The system would only provide a detail about the number of beds available along with their wards.
We would also introduce a subscription-based plan for the users to allow them to allow them to get their query resolved by the doctors, meanwhile restricting the number of questions they can ask to avoid spamming.
